[00:00] welcome to whiteboard programming where
[00:01] we make programming simple for you with
[00:03] easy-to-understand whiteboard videos and
[00:05] today we will talk about five
[00:07] fundamental concepts of programming
[00:09] language if you can figure out how these
[00:10] five concepts work you are most of the
[00:13] way to be able to learn a new language
[00:15] so let&#39;s get started number one
[00:19] variables by definition a variable is a
[00:22] symbolic name or reference to some kind
[00:24] of information this is similar to how a
[00:26] term is used in maths for example if you
[00:29] are using only positive integers then a
[00:31] plus B is always greater than a in this
[00:34] scenario a and B are both variables in
[00:37] computer programming variables allow
[00:40] code to operate for any value being
[00:42] represented by variables but they can be
[00:45] more than just symbolic letters
[00:46] variables can have a number of different
[00:49] properties in computer&#39;s memory such as
[00:51] name type scope lifetime and location
[00:55] and different programming languages call
[00:58] for variables differently but they all
[00:59] use this component number two
[01:02] conditional statements by definition
[01:04] conditional statements are expression
[01:06] that asked the program to determine if a
[01:09] variable is true or false you may also
[01:12] call it boolean values typically if a
[01:14] statement is true the program should
[01:16] perform one action for example action
[01:18] one if the statement is false the
[01:20] program should perform a different
[01:22] action let&#39;s say action two these
[01:23] actions are called conditions number
[01:26] three looping and iterations and
[01:28] iteration is any time a program repeats
[01:31] a process or sequence loops are common
[01:34] type of iterations in which a program
[01:36] performs a certain action for an
[01:38] infinite number of times until a new
[01:40] condition is met these are frequently
[01:42] called as by loops because they often
[01:45] express that while a certain condition
[01:47] is true the program should continue to
[01:49] do a certain action until that condition
[01:52] is false or a new condition is true
[01:54] loops also make it possible for programs
[01:57] to do something else while a given
[01:59] process is running number four data
[02:02] types and data structures data types
[02:04] help classify what information a
[02:07] variable can hold and what can be done
[02:09] with it data types include numbers
[02:12] boolean&#39;s
[02:13] characters and strings on the other hand
[02:15] data structure is a storage format that
[02:18] enables efficient access and
[02:20] modification of data data structures
[02:22] include arrays or lists hashes
[02:25] dictionaries and objects since computer
[02:27] programs can&#39;t tell the difference
[02:29] between data inputs that read one two
[02:31] three four and data inputs that read
[02:34] ABCD they need to know the data type in
[02:36] order to differentiate between the two
[02:38] meanwhile a data structure is also a
[02:41] data type but one that contains an
[02:43] unlimited number of named subcategories
[02:46] in this way a program can parse
[02:48] individual data types while still
[02:50] treating the entire structure as one
[02:53] data type number five functions
[02:56] functions are self-contained modules of
[02:58] code that accomplish a particular task
[03:01] once a function is written it can be
[03:03] called and use again and again they
[03:06] operate like a black box data goes in
[03:08] function operates on the data and
[03:11] process data comes out they also let you
[03:14] reuse the code rather than constantly
[03:16] rewriting it and allowing you to think
[03:19] about your program as a series of sub
[03:22] steps recognizing these five concepts in
[03:25] a computer language will help you kick
